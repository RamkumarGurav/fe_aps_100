                  At Appolo, we look at education as an inviting and exciting
                  journey into the new world of intellectual, spiritual and
                  emotional learning. An educational system that engenders the
                  development and growth of all five aspects of a child's
                  personality - that is the Physical, Cognitive, Aesthetic,
                  Emotional and Spiritual.
